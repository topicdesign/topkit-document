topkit Pages Module
====================

ver:0.0.1

The Pages module is a combination of a templating library and a
dynamic page content generation tool. Elements of the templating
portion of this package were inspired by the fine work of [Phil
Sturgeon](https://github.com/philsturgeon/codeigniter-template).

### Dependencies

* [php-activerecord](https://github.com/topicdesign/php-activerecord-spark)

Pages is designed as one of the core modules included in the
[topkit][tk] framework. It may work for your other projects, but that is
not our intention.

### Initialization

It is recommended to auto-load the pages module.

    $autoload['packages'] = array(APPPATH.'third_party/pages');
    $autoload['libraries'] = array('page');

The library will use the `config/pages.php` file be default, but you can
overload it.

    // pass a config variable to the constructor
    $this->load->library('page', $config);

    // manually initialize
    $this->page->initialize($config);

## Config

| Parameter       | Default       | Description                                                    |
| --------        | -------       | -----------                                                    |
| layout_dir      | views/layouts | path to layouts directory (relative to APPPATH)                |
| default_layout  | default       | file name of default layout file                               |
| title_separator | ' &#124; '    | string to use to separate concatenated titles                  |
| prepend_title   | TRUE          | should new title strings be prepended                          |
| extract_data    | TRUE          | should we extract the data to local variables in layouts/views |

# Usage

## Layouts

You change which layout file to use in the build phase by setting a new path.

    // set the layout to 'views/layouts/simple.php'
    $this->page->layout = 'simple';

## Title

You can set the `title` property to a simple string.

    $this->page->title = 'My Awesome Site';

Alternatively, you can pass multiple strings and allow the library to
combine them on output using the specified `separator`.

    // initialize the title (maybe in a hook)
    $this->page->title('Site Title');

    // get more specific in the controller
    $this->page->title('News'); # News | Site Title

    // and really specific in the method
    $this->page->title('Article Title'); # Article | News | Site Title

You can also pass an array of strings, they will be inserted in the
order provided.

    $this->page->title(array('One', 'Two', 'Three'));
    // One | Two | Three

By default, new strings are prepended to the title, but you can replace
the current contents by passing `TRUE` as a second parameter.

    $this->page->title('Prepend Title');
    $this->page->title('Replace Title', TRUE); 
    

### Output the title

Treat the built up `title` as a normal property on the `Page` object.
By default the segments that have been collected will be ordered in
reverse, but you can toggle prepend/append via the config option.
  
    echo $this->page->title;
    // Article Title | News | Site Title

    $this->page->initialize(array('prepend_title'=>FALSE));
    echo $this->page->title;
    // Site Title | News | Article Title
    

## Partials

Partials allow you to store views in variables to use in your layout
files, or other views.

### Setting partials

Typically you will be setting partials from view files, stored in the
default `APPPATH.'views/'` directory.

    // create a partial called 'header'
    $this->page->partial('header', '_partials/header');

    // pass some data to the view
    $data = array('logged_in'=>TRUE);
    $this->page->partial('footer', '_partials/footer', $data);

There may be times where you want to pass a string directly to a partial.

    $this->page->partial('copy', '<span>&copy;'.date('Y').'</span>');
    $this->page->partial('tweet', get_recent_tweet());

### Getting partials

To use a stored partial in your output, simply look it up using the
assigned name. If the partial does not exist, it will return `FALSE`,
allowing you to echo unset partials without fear of PHP errors.

    // output the contents of the partial
    echo $this->page->partial('header');

    // assign the partial to a new variable
    $tweet = $this->page->partial('tweet');

    // no harm in echoing unset partials
    echo $this->page->partial('does_not_exist');

## Passing Data to views/layouts

CodeIgniter has a method for setting random data using
`$this->output->set_vars()`, and you can pass an array to the `partial`
and `build` methods. As a convenience, the `Page` module also provides
an interface for storing arbitrary data.

    // set any string key to any value
    $this->page->data('username', 'John');
    $this->page->data('user', $user);

    // you can also pass arrays
    $user_data = array(
        'username'  => 'John',
        'user'      => $user
    );
    $this->page->data($user_data);

Any data set using this method is automatically extracted into rendered
views for direct access. You can configure the `Page` module to **not**
extract stored data into local variables, which may be preferable in
some situations to avoid variable collisions.

    // in the layout file, access properties dircectly
    echo $username; // John
    echo $user->created->format('Y'); // 2012

    // or you can access the data from the page object
    echo $this->page->data('username'); // John

    $user = $this->page->data('user');
    echo $user->created->format('Y'); // 2012
